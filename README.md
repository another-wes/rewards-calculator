This is the solution to a coding challenge, solved by Wesley Shiflet the week of January 15th, 2021.

I've provided sample data in the root directory in the file "testdata.csv".  This can be uploaded with the "Choose File" button.  You can also create your own CSV for testing by putting dates (in any JS-readable format) in the first column and dollar amounts in the second.

This repository includes a production build in the /build/ folder, which can be served through npm's "serve -s build" command, as well as the underlying development build.  The development build can be deployed from the root folder through the "npm start" command.
